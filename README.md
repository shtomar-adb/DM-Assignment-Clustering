# Assignment 4: Clustering Techniques. CMPE 255 Data Mining

### Clustering Techniques

The colab in the github repository demonstrates following Clustering techniques:

1. K-Means clustering from scratch
2. Hierarchical clustering (Using scikit learn)
3. Gaussian mixture models clustering (Using scikit learn)
4. DBScan (using Pycaret)

### Data Set

The Clustering techniques are demonstrated using __Wine dataset__, which is imported from Scikit datasets.
